# Project 3
Collaborators: Praveen Manimaran, Vitush Agarwal

Our project focused on creating an interactive visualization to explore internet usage data across various countries, regions, and continents over time. We selected a line chart as our primary visualization because it effectively communicates trends and changes in usage over time, allowing users to observe and compare patterns easily. We applied data transformations to make the visualization more interactive and meaningful, including filtering by continent and country and a year range slider to control the displayed timeframe. Distinct colors are used for each country in multi-country selections, allowing for easy visual differentiation and comparison. We considered using different line styles, such as dashed lines, but found color distinctions to be more intuitive for users.

The development process was a collaborative effort. We divided the work so that one team member focused on setting up the basic HTML structure and configuring D3 to load and render the line chart, while the other handled implementing the interactive elements, including the dropdown filters and year range slider. Together, we brainstormed and refined the visualizationâ€™s design and functionality, carefully considering different design choices before finalizing our approach. Testing across multiple browsers and debugging interactions were crucial to ensuring a user-friendly experience. This project allowed us to balance functionality with user experience, resulting in an engaging and informative tool for data exploration.

We spent roughly 5 hours developing the application, including setup, coding, and testing. The most time-intensive aspects were configuring the interactive elements, particularly synchronizing the filters and year range slider, as well as ensuring all filters worked seamlessly across different user selections. We also paid special attention to accessibility, choosing colors that maintain visibility and contrast for easy data comparison, and creating a layout that allows for intuitive navigation through various filtering options.
